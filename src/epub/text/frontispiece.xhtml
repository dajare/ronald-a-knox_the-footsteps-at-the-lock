				<img alt="A map showing the winding river of the upper Thames flowing from south to north. At the north of the map, a road crosses the river at Eaton Bridge with Oxford to the east, and at the south another road crosses at Millington Bridge with White Bracton to the southwest. Near Millington Bridge, the river splits into two branches forming a small island; the western branch of the river leads to Shipcote Lock, and the eastern branch to a weir. The branches rejoin about three-quarters of a mile below the lock. The lock-keeperâ€™s house is on the mainland to the west of the lock. To the east of the weir is Spinnaker Farm, and beyond it the Shipcote train station." src="../images/map.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
